**Key Git Concepts**
Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.

**Working with Git**
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
You select the modified files you want to Stage
The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
You can revert back to any previous commit.
Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

Key Features:

Version history

Branching & merging

Conflict resolution

Backup & recovery

Collaboration support
